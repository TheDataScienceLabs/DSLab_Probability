    "In this lab, we will be using a Python library called OpenCV (cv2). According to the [official documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d1/dfb/intro.html), \"OpenCV is an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms.\" Today, we will primarily utilize it to read and display modified video frames, and we will manually handle the \"vision\" aspect of computer vision with our own functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following code cell to read the video file. The `vid.read()` function returns two values: a Boolean variable `success`, which is `True` if the frame was read without any errors, and `frame`, which represents the captured image from the video. Since the camera hardware connected to your Pico can only provide grayscale images, we will convert each frame to grayscale using the `cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)` function. To improve computation speed, we have scaled down each frame by a factor of 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you run the cell, a separate window will pop up (potentially appearing behind other windows on your screen), displaying the smaller, grayscale video. The separate window will automatically close after reading the entire video. However, you can override this behavior by pressing the `Q` key on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
