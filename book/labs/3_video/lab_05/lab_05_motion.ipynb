    "\n",
    "1. the camera is stationary\n",
    "2. the background is static\n",
    "3. the lighting conditions do not change\n",
    "4. there is minimal noise in the image\n",

For instance, if a camera is set up to monitor a doorway, most of the time, nothing is in motion within the frame. By selecting an initial reference frame, we can compare all subsequent frames to the reference frame."

To demonstrate an example, we will utilize the same test video from the previous lab. To keep things concise, we won't delve into the detailed workings of `cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()`. Generally, this method is slightly more robust against illumination changes.
