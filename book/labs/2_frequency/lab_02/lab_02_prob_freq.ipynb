Once the firmware is installed, you may need to press the `STOP/RESTART` button multiple times until the Micropython shell appears on the bottom tab of Thonny. Once you see the Micropython shell, the Pico is connected to Thonny.\n",

In the side bar, navigate to your *\"Downloads\"* folder. If you're unsure, you can find it at `/home/shay/a/\"your username\"/Downloads`. Right-click the `pico_temperature.py` file and choose *\"Upload to /\"* to copy the file onto your Pico.\n",
