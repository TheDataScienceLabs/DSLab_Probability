    "In [The Data Science Labs on Mulitvariable Calculus](https://thedatasciencelabs.github.io/DataLab_Multivariate_Calculus/intro.html), we briefly introduce uniform quantization methods. Quantization of images refers to the process of reducing the information in an image from a wider range of values to a smaller range. Quantization is used for image compression to save storage space on devices, for creating image filters, and for processes like printing. As we saw observed in the previous lab on texture identification, grayscale images contain values between 0 and 255. However, what if we could only use 5 or 10 discrete values? In that case, we would require a mapping or function that transforms our original range of 0-255 to the 5 or 10 new discrete levels."
