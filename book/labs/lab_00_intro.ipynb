To create the folder, go to the Home directory and right-click to add a new folder.

To download and save the file to your folder, click on the \"Raw\" button located at the top right of the file preview (unless it's a PDF, in which case, simply click \"Download\").

I will not be a cheater.”\n"

On the other hand, code cells display code in a well-formatted structure, intended for both humans and computers to comprehend. The text you are currently reading belongs to a markdown cell. The code cell below, displayed in gray, is an example of a code cell. By executing the code cell, each line of code is sequentially executed, and the output of the last line is displayed beneath the cell. To execute cells, you can press the \"shift\" key while simultaneously pressing the \"enter\" key (`Shift+Enter`)."
