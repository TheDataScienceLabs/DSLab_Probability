    "One of the reasons Latex is so popular is that you can use the same formulas in different places, and they will show up differently based on context. If you want to put Latex in a line of text (without its own line) you can just put your code between dollar signs (`$`) like this: $e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}.$ Notice that the sum is written smaller, so it doesn't break up the text as much, but I used the exact same code.\n",

    "A lot of the symbols we like to use in math are not on a typical keyboard. If you want a lower case sigma, you are usually out of luck. In Latex you can write a lower case sigma by writing `\\sigma`, which shows up like $\\sigma$. Everything written after a backslash (the symbol `\\`, which is found just under the backspace key on most keyboards) is not printed, but instead is treated like a command. In this case, the command is \"put a letter sigma here\". To do a capital sigma, just type `\\Sigma` with a capital `S`, like so $\\Sigma$.\n",

    "It is really common in math to want to write a superscript like the 2 in $x^2$ or the $r$ in $\\varepsilon_r$. We do that with the `^` and `_` keys (caret and underscore). **Watch out**: Latex is different from Python. In Python, we would write $x^2$ as `x**2`. It can be easy to get mixed up when switching back and forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another thing to watch out for: the subscript (or superscript) only works on the first thing after it. So, if I try to raise x to the 23rd power with just one caret (`x^23`) I get this: $x^23$. No good! In order to fix this, we will tell the 2 and the 3 that they go together. We use the `{` and `}` symbols (braces) to group things together in Latex. I can type this instead as `x^{23}` which gives $x^{23}$.\n",

    "Fractions in Latex are a bit unusual in that they act on the *two* symbols which come after them. If I write `\\frac12` that makes $\\frac12$. Usually, fractions have more than one character in the numerator and denominator, so you will usually write a fraction with two pairs of braces, `\\frac{1}{2}`. That is easier to read anyhow, I think. This makes it possible to more complicated fractions, or even fractions inside of fractions.\n",
