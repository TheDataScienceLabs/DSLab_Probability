To create the folder, go to the Home directory and right-click to add a new folder.

To download and save the file to your folder, click on the \"Raw\" button located at the top right of the file preview (unless it's a PDF, in which case, simply click \"Download\"). This will lead you to a white page displaying the information in black text. To view the file in the appropriate environment, right-click the screen and select \"Save as...\".

I will not be a cheater.”\n"

    "The application you are currently using is an IPython Notebook. An IPython Notebook consists of two types of cells: **Markdown** cells and **Code** cells. Markdown cells are used to present text in a nicely-formatted manner for readers, while code cells display code in a well-formatted structure intended for both humans and computers to comprehend. The text you are currently reading belongs to a markdown cell. The code cell below, displayed in gray, serves as an example of a code cell. When you execute the code cell, each line of code is sequentially executed, and the output of the last line is displayed beneath the cell. To execute cells, simply press the \"Shift\" key while simultaneously pressing the \"Enter\" key (Shift+Enter)."
