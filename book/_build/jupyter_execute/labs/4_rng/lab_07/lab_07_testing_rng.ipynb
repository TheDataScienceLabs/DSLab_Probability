The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed formal tests to assist in evaluating the randomness of a randomly generated binary sequence consisting of 0s and 1s. In this lab, we will implement several of these NIST tests and attempt to determine which of the RNGs from the previous lab perform the best."
