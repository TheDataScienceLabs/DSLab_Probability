    "Random number generators (RNGs) are the foundation of computer security. The ability to send encrypted messages depends on RNGs. Secure systems are undoubtedly important as the value of our personal data is ever increasing. Whether it's financial information, medical records, or simply messages to a friend, information is protected by generating random numbers unpredictable enough to prevent a hacker from guessing what's next. Random numbers are needed for a variety of tasks like drawing lottery numbers, choosing random samples for scientific studies, and creating video games.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNGs have a surprisingly long history, dating back 5000 years ago with coin-flipping and dice-rolling as the main methods. Many modern approaches are hardware-based as well but much faster than rolling dice repeatedly. For example, in 1996, Silicon Graphics patented a system of random number generation using a wall of lava lamps. The exact state of a lava lamp, let alone multiple, at any time is too complex to model and predict, and so any number based on this chaotic system is secure. Another true RNG is [RANDOM.ORG](https://www.random.org/), which uses multiple radio receivers capturing atmospheric noise to create its random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "True RNGs (TRNGs) are characterized by having no predictable patterns in generated sequences and are generally slow to output a large amount of random numbers. TRNGs are relatively hard to implement as a computer program, so pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) allow computers to simulate randomness through a deterministic process or an easy rule for the program to follow. PRNGs need a starting value called a seed and then based on the seed value pull up a previously created list of random numbers. PRNGs are not always safe enough to use for cryptographic purposes, but having a truly random seed makes them less predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will create a random binary sequence of ones and zeros using different hardware methods and test them mathematically to judge the randomness of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only need a random binary sequence to generate random numbers in any range. The reasons behind this are that we can convert between number bases and that computers store numbers in a finite amount of bits. A bit is the smallest unit of information a computer can store. Bits are either 0 or 1. Python uses 32 or 64 bits to store floating-point numbers and integers."

During the heartbeat, the volume of blood is high, and after each heartbeat, it is low.\n",

During the diastolic phase, the blood has flown back into the heart.
