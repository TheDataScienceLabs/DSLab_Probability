## The Data Science Labs on Probability

**|| By Alden Bradford and Mireille Boutin with Kindyl King and Naazneen Rana ||**

Welcome to || MA16290 ||, The Data Science Labs on Probability! This is a one-credit course to accompany ECE302 or any other course on probability. In this course, you will explore applications of probability to problems in data science. You will also practice programming in Python and how to use Arduino sensors and microprocessors.

This course requires no work outside of the lab. It has no homework, quizzes, tests, or exams. All work is performed during the 150 minutes spent in the lab each week. Our friendly undergraduate instructors will assist you and answer all your questions during lab time.

Purdue Students: You can earn Honors credit for || || by taking this lab. See the syllabus for details.

## How to Get Started

You are reading an interactive Notebook written in the Jupyter language. Jupyter allows a collection of files to be neatly compiled into a single web page, such as the one you're looking at. It also allows you to write and compile Python code.

The application used to make these Notebooks is JupyterLab, which you'll be using to interact with and edit the labs.

To get started with this course, click the next arrow at the bottom left of this page to get to the first lab. This lab will explain how to interact with the Notebook, including running code, editing cells, and other useful features that can be used in Jupyter. Throughout the lab, you will be asked to perform some exercises. You will write your answers directly in the Notebook. In other words, you will need to edit the lab file. We recommend downloading the file and opening it in JupyterLab to edit the lab.

To begin editing this lab, click the download icon in the top right of the screen and download the _.ipynb_ version of Lab 0. After this, open the JupyterLab application. This will bring you to a screen with files and a Table of Contents on the left side and a screen on the right side. If not already open, open the files directory by clicking on the folder icon in the top left corner. Open the _Downloads_ file, double-click _lab_0.ipynb_, and follow the directions in this lab to begin.

To turn in the labs on Brightspace, you must export the file as a PDF. To do this, navigate to _File_, _Save and Export Notebook as_, and then click on _PDF_. This will be further explained in Laboratory 0.

Please ask the instructor for assistance if you have any questions or are experiencing difficulties during these labs.
