    "$\\LaTeX$ (pronounced \"law-tek\" or \"lay-tek\") is a widely-used and well-established tool for creating beautifully typeset documents. It has been around for a long time and is commonly employed in various ways, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    " - writing submissions for academic journals\n",
    " - composing textbooks\n",
    " - preparing fiction books for publication\n",
    " - crafting assignments and exams for students\n",

    " - writing personal letters to friends\n",

    "Many mathematicians rely heavily on $\\LaTeX$ when creating written documents. In this course, we will only utilize a small fraction of $\\LaTeX$â€”specifically, the part that allows us to display formulas nicely. Markdown interpreters, including the one integrated with JupyterLab, have the capability to convert $\\LaTeX$ expressions into beautifully rendered formulas. That's how it is possible to present a formula like:\n",

    "One of the reasons why $\\LaTeX$ is so popular is its ability to present the same formulas in different ways based on the context. If you want to include a formula within a line of text (without starting a new line), you can enclose the code with dollar signs `($)` like this: $e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}$. Notice that the sum is displayed smaller to avoid disrupting the flow of the text, yet the code used remains the same.\n",

    "## Escape sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Many mathematical symbols that we commonly use are not readily available on a typical keyboard. For instance, if you want to use a lowercase sigma, you might not find it directly. However, in $\\LaTeX$, you can represent a lowercase sigma by typing `\\sigma`, which will be displayed as $\\sigma$. Anything written after a backslash (symbol: `\\`, typically found below the backspace key on most keyboards) is treated as a command rather than being printed directly. In this case, the command is to \"insert a lowercase sigma here\". For a capital sigma, you can simply type `\\Sigma` with a capital 'S', resulting in $\\Sigma$.\n",

    "## Subscripts, superscripts, and grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite common in mathematics to express superscripts, such as the exponent 2 in $x^2$ or the subscript $r$ in $\\varepsilon_r$. This is achieved using the caret (`^`) and underscore (`_`) keys. However, it is important to note that LaTeX differs from Python syntax. In Python, we would write $x^2$ as `x**2`, so it's crucial to avoid confusion when switching between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect to be mindful of is that the superscript or subscript applies only to the immediate element following it. Consequently, if we attempt to raise $x$ to the 23rd power using a single caret (`x^23`), the result will be $x^23$, which is incorrect. To rectify this, we need to group the numbers 2 and 3 together using braces ({ and }), as in `x^{23}`, resulting in $x^{23}$.\n",

    "## Fractions and parentheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Fractions in LaTeX behave differently compared to regular symbols. When writing a fraction, such as `\\frac12`, it affects the two symbols that follow it, resulting in $\\frac12$. However, in most cases, fractions involve more than one character in the numerator and denominator, so it is recommended to use two pairs of braces, like `\\frac{1}{2}`. This not only improves readability but also allows for more complex fractions, including fractions within fractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{pq}{p+q} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in \"text mode\" (the smaller in-line text denoted by `$`), fractions appear smaller, while in \"display mode,\" they are larger by default. However, if you want to override this behavior, you can use the command `\\tfrac` to consistently display smaller-style fractions or the command `\\dfrac` to always use the display style.\n",
    "\n",
    "In expressions involving fractions, the height of the expression can often exceed that of a single character, resulting in unappealing visuals.\n",

    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "1 = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (\\frac{1}{2})^n\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
