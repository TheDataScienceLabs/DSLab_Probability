Schedule: (15 weeks) 
- Week 1 lab 0 - skill checks, LED exercise
- Week 2 programing overview
- Week 3/4 temperature, texture
- Week 5/6 histogram equalization
- Week 7 intro to cameras from the calc 3 lab
- Week 8 motion detection
- Week 9 build rng
- Week 10 test rng
- Week 11/12 pi
- Week 13/14/15 heartbeat and linear regression

Summer TAs:
- All the drafted labs are under the Labs folder of the github repo (https://github.com/TheDataScienceLabs/DSLab_Probability)
- it will be noted in the labs usually in bold text where further testing needs to be done
- number the exercises in each lab and add more/split up exercises if needed
- when you're done testing, remove solutions where noted
- you can build the jupyter book by copying the calc 2 or calc 3 data science labs repo structure
- when the file system is finalized, fill in hyperlinks to github for images or scripts (they should be in bold text in the labs to add link)

Notes for Teaching:
- I suggest creating a gradescope assignment for every week. For example, for Lab 2 create two assignments separating the exercises.
- In the syllabus, add that labs will be graded as 0 if the student does not assign pages from their pdf to exercises in gradescope.

Helpful People:
- Mimi and Chris Janjigian for writing help
- Adarsh for hardware help
- Kindyl (I helped write these labs and the Calc 3 ones, contact me in Slack and I'll try to reply as soon as I can)

Misc:
- See if any exercises work well in a group? Most of the labs are done individually but that can get a little lonely
-
